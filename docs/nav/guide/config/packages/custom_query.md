# Configuration for Custom query

If you're not using [dq-tools](https://hub.getdbt.com/infinitelambda/dq_tools) package or even [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), no problem, we're supporting a custom query directly to your data table/view.

The steps are as follows:

## 1. Prepare SQL script

Assuming we have a custom script named `issues.sql` which is located in the current directory.

The script has to provide the expected columns required for all modules below:

- `test_id`: the unique identifier of the test.
- `test_status`: status of the test: 'pass', 'warn', 'fail', 'deprecate'. Example: `accepted_values_my_first_dbt_model_id__False__1__2.ee252c12b8`
- `test_title`: test's title to be shown in your module (e.g. in the Jira module, `test_title` is used as the issue's summary: `ðŸŸ¡ | Warning in test: test_id [dq-tools]`).
- `check_timestamp`: test execution timestamp.
- `no_of_records_scanned`: number of rows scanned.
- `no_of_records_failed`: number of rows that did not pass the test.
- `failed_rate`: percentage of no_of_records_failed / no_of_records_scanned (e.g `no_of_records_failed / nullif(no_of_records_scanned, 0) as failed_rate`).
- `tag_1`: your 1st test tag (e.g. 'accepted_value').
- `tag_2`: your 2nd test tag (e.g. `Accuracy).
- `prev_statuses`: an array of previous statuses (e.g `array_agg(test_status_emoji) within group (order by check_timestamp desc) as prev_statuses`).
- `prev_check_timestamps`: an array of previous execution times of this test (e.g `array_agg(check_timestamp) within group (order by check_timestamp desc) as prev_check_timestamps`).
- `prev_no_of_records_scanned`: an array of previous row scanned (e.g `array_agg(no_of_records_scanned) within group (order by check_timestamp desc) as prev_no_of_records_scanned`).
- `prev_no_of_records_failed`: an array of previous row failed (e.g `array_agg(no_of_records_failed) within group (order by check_timestamp desc) as prev_no_of_records_failed`).
- `priority`: your priority level for each test. This field will be used for ordering the issues list in all modules. It is recommended to use numbers to simplify the process.

Let's build your `SELECT` query:

```sql
-- issue.sql

select  'your_value' as title,
        ...

from    your_table
```

## 2. Alerting

### Setting up env vars

Set up Query variables: [Query Variables Config](./query_variables.html)

Set up Alert Module variables:

- [JIRA Configuration](.https://diqu.iflambda.com/latest/nav/guide/config/alerts/jira.html)
- [SLACK Configuration](https://diqu.iflambda.com/latest/nav/guide/config/alerts/slack.html)

### Executing alert actions
```bash
# prepare the env vars first
...
# run alerting
diqu alert --query-file issue.sql
```
